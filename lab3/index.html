		<h1> Lab 3 File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
		<p>The purpose of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>While editing the files was generally easy, I got caught up in the details sometimes. For example, I had trouble editing my image because I wasn't id-ing it properly. I need to slow down and do things properly!</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>This very webpage is the result! Check out my screenshots of the file structure.</p>
