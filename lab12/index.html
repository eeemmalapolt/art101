    	<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
      <p>The purpose of this lab was to use functions with conditionals, specifically if-statements, and else if-statements.</p>
      <div id="challenge">
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>I had to create a function that would sort users into one of four Hogwarts houses based on the length of their name.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="problems">
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>I had wanted to use jQuery in my JS file to save time, but it ended up taking up more time because I wasn't sure how to do it. So eventually I just defaulted to normal JavaScript.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The results are in the box below! See what house you get sorted into.</p>
      </div>
      <p></p>
      <div id="input-content">
        <h3>Welcome to H*gwarts</h3>
        <p>Prepare to be sorted into your house.</p>
        Please enter your FULL name for sorting:
        <input type="text" id="input">
