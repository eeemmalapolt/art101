	<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
</head>
<body>
	<p>The purpose of this lab was to learn the process of creating pseudocode through real life activities.</p>
	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p>We have decided to make a pseudocode for streaming music. We listed the things a music player, such as Spotify, would do when we, as user, pick a song to play. We also considered what tasks it will implement with settings
		decided beforehand,such as shuffle and loop.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>There were little to no problems during this lab, other than getting  teletype to work!</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Good stuff. We made two lists of pseudocode, one for solitaire and one for streaming music. We then updated our work on here!</p>

		//Get a deck of cards
		//Shuffle cards
		//Set up the cards
		  //Place tableau of cards in 7 columns from left to right in ascending order of 1 stacked card to 7, face down
		  //Flip all card on the surface over to reveal their number and pattern
		  //Place the rest in “stock” pile, all face down
		  //Leave room for the foundation and waste
		//Move any Aces (if there are any face up) in the tableau to the foundation
		//Stack cards in tableau in alternating color order by descending faces
		//Stack cards in foundation organized by face in ascending order (Ace to King). when this is complete, the game is won
		//If there are every no possible moves, pull a card from the stock pile
